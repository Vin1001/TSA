My built-from-scratch derivative-based hyperplane fitter and its implementation in predicting stock prices

## Derivative-based hypeplane fitter
Let us consider the input matrix as

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To fit an intercept A becomes

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n-1} & 1 \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n-1} & 1 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn-1} & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) estimator for the input matrix is defined to be

$$
\beta = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T y
$$

where y is the target vector and Î² is the weight vector. However, OLS is highly sensitive to outliers since squaring induces unnecessary bias in the model. To overcome the problem of squaring, I developed derivative-based estimation, which uses:

$$
\beta = (D^T A)^{-1} D^T y
$$

where 

$$
D = \begin{bmatrix}
    1/a_{11} & 1/a_{12} & \cdots & 1/a_{1n-1} & 1 \\
    1/a_{21} & 1/a_{22} & \cdots & 1/a_{2n-1} & 1 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    1/a_{m1} & 1/a_{m2} & \cdots & 1/a_{mn-1} & 1
\end{bmatrix}, (a_{ij} \neq 0\)
$$

### Intuitive meaning:
#### - Through this approach the change of an input variable with respect to other input variables is found out.
#### - The target variable per unit input variable also conveys an intuitive meaning as to which variable has the most impact on the target vector.
#### - Reduced sesitivity to outliers- Using the model with z-score normalized data, will automatically diminish the effect of values which have more deviation from mean.

## Stock Price Application

Using a sliding window application for the derivative-based fitter, not only have i developed a sliding window stock price predictor but also a prediction mechanism to incorporate the fluctuations in the stock prices using binary trees. The figure below is an illustration as to how binary tees are applied in prediction:
