My built-from-scratch derivative-based hyperplane fitter and its implementation in predicting stock prices

## Derivative-based hypeplane fitter
Lets consider the input matrix as

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To fit an intercept A becomes

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n-1} & 1 \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n-1} & 1 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn-1} & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) estimator for the input matrix is defined to be

$$
\beta = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T y
$$

where y is the target vector and Î² is the weight vector. However, OLS is highly sensitive to outliers since squaring induces unnecessary bias in the model. To overcome the problem of squaring, I developed derivate-based estimation, which uses:

$$
\beta = (D^T A)^{-1} D^T y
$$

where 

$$
D = \begin{bmatrix}
    1/a_{11} & 1/a_{12} & \cdots & 1/a_{1n-1} & 1 \\
    1/a_{21} & 1/a_{22} & \cdots & 1/a_{2n-1} & 1 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    1/a_{m1} & 1/a_{m2} & \cdots & 1/a_{mn-1} & 1
\end{bmatrix}(a_{ij} \neq 0\)
$$
